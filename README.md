## Automatic Bank Reconciliation

Automatic Bank Reconciliation can speed up the accounting process. This option enables you to upload an electronic version of a bank statement (provided by the bank) and ‘automatically’ reconcile it to your system bank using ‘Matching’ rule.

Prepare Bank Statement File to upload:
Download a bank statement and format it as per the 'Bank Statement Template' provided by the system and save this file to a known folder on your PC/File Server where you can later retrieve it.

Importing this formatted file into the system and updating clearance date is straightforward. Within the 'Bank Statement' screen click on the 'Upload' button to upload the formatted bank statement file into ERPNext. This will fill the Bank Statement grid with the data. Click on 'View Clearance Date' button. This will fetch the system bank data and fill the Clearance Date column, cross check the Clearance Date and click on 'Update Clearance Date' button. This will update the Clearance Date in ERPNext.

Matching Rule:
System will match data based on Transaction Type, Transaction Amount and serial Number (Cheque Number)
